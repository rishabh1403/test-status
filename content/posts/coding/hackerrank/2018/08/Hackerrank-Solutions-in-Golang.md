# Starting Golang
I used to do competitive programming in my college days and from there on moved to web development. It's been a long time since I looked back and I think it's high time I should start coding again. I also started learning [Golang](https://golang.org/) recently, so I think it would be better to practice it on some code snippets online and test it for time and space complexity along the way. 
## Choosing a platform
Now that the task is decided, it is time to choose a platform. There are many options out there. Some famous ones are [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/), [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/) etc. I chose to go with [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to start with. I have used all of these platforms before and [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) provides some basic questions for warmup and all, so yeah, will start from [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). As I had no prior knowledge of [Golang](https://golang.org/) I wanted to go with a platform where I could start from very basic.
## Posting solutions
I would be posting solutions to all the questions that I solve as blog posts here explaining the approach I took, what problems I faced and so on. The solutions would be in [Golang](https://golang.org/) because that is the language I am trying to learn here.

Stay tuned and see you later :)
